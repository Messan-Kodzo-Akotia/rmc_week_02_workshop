# Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal, and Nutritional Disease Burden (CMNN)

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the communicable diseases data
data_cmnn <- read_csv(here("data", "burden-of-disease-cmnn.csv"))
```

## Table of Estimates for CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries 
data_cmnn2 <- data_cmnn %>% 
  rename(DALY = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)

data_cmnn_3 <- data_cmnn2 %>% 
  filter(Entity %in% c("Switzerland", "Senegal", "Togo")) %>% 
  select(Entity, DALY, Year)

# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column
data_cmnn_4 <- pivot_wider(data_cmnn_3, names_from = Entity, values_from = DALY)

library(tidyr)
data_cmnn_5 <- unnest(data_cmnn_4)

# Convert columns to numeric
data_cmnn_5 <- data_cmnn_5 %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric))

# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
kable(data_cmnn_5, caption = "DALY burden over time for Senegal-Germany-Togo")
```

## Plot Showing Trends in CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

melted_data <- pivot_longer(data_cmnn_5, cols = -Year, names_to = "Country", values_to = "DALY")

# Plot
ggplot(melted_data, aes(x = Year, y = DALY, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "DALY Burden Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "DALY Burden") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

## Summary of CMNN Burden Findings

Provide a brief analysis based on the data presented in the table and chart. Highlight any significant findings or patterns. About 3 sentences

```{r}
print("In Senegal and Togo, a noticeable downward trend in the DALY burden was observed, with a slight increase observed around 1999. In Switzerland, on the other hand, the initially low DALY burden has been relatively stable, with a tendency to decline over time..")
